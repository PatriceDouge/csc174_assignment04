 # Information Architecture(for Monday 26): 
 
  ## Content: 
    * The three students that created the team lagos website already all have one thing in common: born in Africa. 
    * They used "Africans in Diaspora" has the title of their website. To relate with this, I am part of a "dispora"; however, 
    this diaspora is in relation to Haiti. I was born in Haiti and moved to the US at the age of 8. Therefore, the odd-member 
    will be me. I am part of a "dispora" but from a different continent. This will help keep the overall dispora theme, while
    still being able to show the difference between me and the other three members. 
    
  ## Layout: 
    * The layout that will work best I believe is two long scrolling pages. The first being an introduction to what a dispora
    is, touching on the different types of disporas. The second should introduce the three common members. Following that,
    with the same format, inroduce me, touching on my differences. At the end of this, this user will have an understanding of 
    what a dispora is and examples of it from two perspectives. The form should be at the end of the page, asking the user 
    relavent questions. 
    * Nav bar should be at the top of the page, above everuthing - unlike how the previous team lagos did. 
    * Headers and paragraphs would follow a centered format with relavent pictures wrapped by the text. 
    * Fonts for the paragraghs should all be the same. To follow the african theme, there are a few "African fonts" that could
    be used to express that theme. 
    * A possible format would be to have a 100% wide picture of africa for the pages at the top of the page(~400 px height). 
    On top of that background we can title the page with the African font. For example "Home" or "The dispora".
    
  ## Web form: 
    *The web form should follow this basic format: 
    1. Where you born in the United States? (Textfield)
    2. If not, where were you born? If so, stop here. (Textfield)
    3. More questions to come up with..

    .
    Submit(button). 
    *What happens after the submit button is pressed is still being decided.
